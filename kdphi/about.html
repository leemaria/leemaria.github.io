<h1>National History</h1>
<p>alpha Kappa Delta Phi was established at the University of California at Berkeley in the Fall of 1989 and was recognized by the College Panhellenic Association on February 7, 1990. The founding sisters - Susan Kim, Fannie Pon, Jill Yoshimura, and Reina Yuan - dedicated themselves to establishing a strong and lasting organization which would provide Asian American women the opportunity to participate in the Greek system. Soon after being recognized by the College Panhellenic Association the founding sisters brought together a diverse group of women who shared with them the goals of sisterhood, scholarship, and leadership. These ideals were to later set the foundation for alpha Kappa Delta Phi's purpose.</p>
<p>The love and generosity that each member had for the organization was instrumental to the growth of alpha Kappa Delta Phi's reputation as a sorority, as well as to the forging of unbreakable friendships. The sisterhood has since then spread to prominent university campuses across the country. To meet the needs of the growing sisterhood, the National Board of alpha Kappa Delta Phi was established in May of 1993 at the National Convention in Santa Barbara, California.</p>
<p>It is the sincere wish of the founding sisters and the charter class that alpha Kappa Delta Phi continue to promote Asian Awareness in the community and leadership opportunities for women by providing each women with the resources, unique sisterly support and understanding to achieve her goals in life.</p>

<h1>University of Michigan, Lambda Chapter History</h1>
<p>alpha Kappa Delta Phi, also known as KDPhi, was founded by Susan Kim, Fannie Pon, Jill Yoshimura, and Reina Yuan in the Fall of 1989 at the University of California, Berkeley. On February 7, 1990 the College Panhellenic Association at the UC Berkeley campus formally recognized the Alpha Chapter of alpha Kappa Delta Phi. The sorority was founded on the ideas and fundamentals of Sisterhood, Scholarship, Leadership, and Asian Pacific American awareness in the University, and community, while seeking to encourage the expression of the individual.
In the fall of 1995, the tradition of alpha Kappa Delta Phi continued at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The colony at the University of Michigan was officially founded on October 14, 1995. The Charter Class consisted of twelve women: Tricia Bagamasbad, May Chan, Jihwon Chang, Li-Hsing Chou, Jennifer Chua, Lien Fu, Mafan Gong, Caroline Huang, Min Jung Kim, Mona Kwan, Jenny Tai, and Irene Yuan. Through the dedication, friendship, and commitment of the Charter class, the U of M colony became a part of national alpha Kappa Delta Phi history.
Since the installation of the Charter class, alpha Kappa Delta Phi at the University of Michigan has continued to flourish. The Alphas, Beta Babes, Gamma Gals, Delta Dolls, Epsilon Elites, Zeta Zeniths, Eta Elits, Theta Treasures, Iota Inspiration, Kappa Kupids, Lambda Lovelies, Mu Mystiques, Nu Naturals, Xi Xplicits, Omicron Ooh la las, Pi Platinums, Rho Rockstars, Sigma Sensations, Tau Talents, Upsilon Ultimates, Phi Phenomenons, Chi Classics, and Psi Primers, although different in class, personality, and style were united by common experiences and memories. Each sister, in contributing something unique and valuable, has made alpha Kappa Delta Phi at the University of Michigan what it is today.</p>
<p>The sisters at the University of Michigan contribute to both the University and Ann Arbor communities. Through participation in numerous service projects, workshops, and APA events, the sisters have proven themselves to be an integral part of the University as a whole. The sisters showed their dedication throughout the 1996-1997 school year, by striving hard to maintain relations within the Universitys APA community, and also with other alpha Kappa Delta Phi chapters outside Michigan. Consequently, the University of Michigan Colony of alpha Kappa Delta Phi was granted Associate Chapter status by the National Board at the 1997 National Convention in Los Angeles, California.
During the following year, the mid-west region expanded with new colonies at the University of Illinois at Chicago and Michigan State University. The UMich sisters eagerly and enthusiastically helped both colonies successfully complete their pledge periods. The constant communication led to strong friendships and bonds in the mid-west region.</p>
<p>At the 1999 National Convention, in recognition of the UMich sisters numerous contributions, full-fledge chapter status was granted. As the University of Michigan became the Lambda Chapter of alpha Kappa Delta Phi, it established the mid-west as a region separate from the east coast, which led to the appointment of a mid-west governor to the National Board of alpha Kappa Delta Phi. As growth in the mid-west continues, the sisters at Michigan will continue to honor the relationships with sisters regionally and nationally through respect and dedication.</p>
<p>With the firm belief in timeless friendship through sisterhood, alpha Kappa Delta Phi at the University of Michigan continues to grow and prosper, embracing tradition and shaping the future.</p>

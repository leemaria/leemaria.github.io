<!--<p>Come back soon for the Fall 2010 Alpha Alpha Class rush schedule!</p>-->


<h1>What is rush?</h1>
<p>Rush is a period during the beginning of each semester which you become better acquainted with the sisters and learn more about the sorority. Rush is intended for rushees to learn more about the sisterhood and whether or not it is something she is looking for. We warmly welcome anyone who is interested in discovering what aKDPhi has to offer to join us in our events. All rush events are free for rushees and there is no obligation to join.</p>

<h1>Why rush aKDPhi?</h1>
<p>alpha Kappa Delta Phi is the first and only internationally recognized asian&ndash;interest sorority. The sisters of aKDPhi are active members of the University as well as the surrounding community, and can be found in honor societies, as leaders of other APIA organizations, volunteers in service organizations, amongst other things. You ask why rush aKDPhi? We say, why not? Rush is a period of time where rushees are given the opportunity to find out more about all the greek organizations on campus. There is also no obligation to join. We encourage our rushees to also find out about other greek organizations to determine what is right for her.</p>
<p>Moreover, being a member of our sorority can offer many benefits. Joining a sorority can enhance your undergraduate life by: a) expanding your social and professional network b) allowing you to experience personal growth in dealing with a diverse group of women c) offering you a chance to challenge yourself in leadership roles d) creating friendships through sisterhood that will last a lifetime, and e) so much more!</p>

<h1>Do I have to be Asian?</h1>
<p>Definitely not. As an organization that seeks to promote cultural awareness, we hold the concept of equality in the highest regard. alpha Kappa Delta Phi does not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, age, national origin, or sexual orientation. We are an all&ndash;inclusive sorority. Any woman who shares similar interests and values is encouraged to join regardless of their own cultural identity. alpha Kappa Delta Phi is composed of the diverse backgrounds and lifestyles of each individual sister. Each member adds her unique experience and spirit to the sorority, building the sisterhood that we are so proud of. We encourage ambitious and motivated women interested in enhancing their college years (and beyond) to attend rush</p>

<h1>What is a bid?</h1>
<p>When a sorority extends a bid to a rushee, it is a invitation to continue to learn more about the sorority, the sisters, and our traditions.</p>
<h1>What makes aKDPhi different from other soroities?</h1>
<p>Let us be honest for a minute, if you had hundreds of hours to devote to this question &mdash; that still wouldn&rsquo;t be enough time for us to tell you what sets us apart from everyone else. (Just kidding, we&rsquo;re exaggerating). Let&rsquo;s start by forgetting those drunken, silly, dramatic girls you&rsquo;ve seen on MTV because aKDPhi is about to show you a whole different side to sorority life. aKDPhi is inarguably the LARGEST and most established Asian&ndash;American interest sorority in the nation. With 47 chapters nationwide (believe me when I say that you will NOT find this type of geological diversity in any other Asian&ndash;American sorority), we boast the largest and most well respected Asian&ndash;American sorority in the United States. We have a proud history of tradition, sisterhood, love, and success, and it is for this reason that we encourage any motivated and ambitious woman interested in enhancing her years at University of Michigan to come out and Rush aKDPhi. aKDPhi sisters are as successful as we are because we are well&ndash;rounded. We don&rsquo;t just focus on one aspect like the social scene, or academics, or culture, or community service &mdash; we dip our bodies into EVERYTHING! And for good reason &mdash; being a strong, intelligent, and independent woman means experiencing different aspects of what UMich, our community, and life has to offer. alpha Kappa Delta Phi isn&rsquo;t just about hard work, either, the foundation of our organization lies with our sisterhood. We&rsquo;ll be honest here when we say we would be nothing without our sisterhood. Imagine your very best friend from childhood, and multiply her times fifty because that&rsquo;s what we have in each other. Every minute spent together is spent laughing and smiling, sharing bits of ourselves and our pasts, and building upon a sisterhood that is unparalleled. If anything, so far, has interested you, or sounds like something you want to experience in college and in life, we encourage you to join us at RUSH! </p>

<h1>How can I learn more about alpha Kappa Delta Phi?</h1>
<p>You&rsquo;ve definitely started in the right place. By taking the time to look through our website, you&rsquo;ll begin to take a look at the life of an aKDPhi. There are so many things to see here, so be sure to take the time to read through our past events, articles, alumnae testimonials, and much more! If you like what you see, we encourage you to take the next step and come out to RUSH! </p>

<p>At the beginning of the Fall and Spring semesters, we host a two&ndash;week rush program for interested girls. Rush is designed to help you learn more about our sorority background, our mission here at UMich, and most importantly to get a feel for the personality and sisters of this chapter. We host a variety of events during these two weeks such as hot pot, mixers, bbq, and sisterhood events &mdash; all of which are <b>COMPLETELY FREE OF CHARGE</b> &mdash; no hidden fees or obligations! (And lucky you, we provide the rides!) Since going through with the new member initiation for a sorority is a very important decision for the interested participant as well as for the sisters, getting to know our rushees is the main goal of our rush process. By meeting and talking with the sisters, rushees can come to realize the purposes of the sorority. If you&rsquo;re asking yourself, "Is this for me?" Well, this is the perfect time to find out &mdash; Come out to rush, we guarantee that you won&rsquo;t regret it! Just look out for our sisters wearing purple and white on campus!</p>

<p>Lastly, if you&rsquo;re ever in class or walking along the streets of South University, don&rsquo;t be afraid to walk up to a sister, and ask her questions about our organization &mdash; she will be more than happy to answer any questions or concerns you may have! Just look out for sisters bearing the letters Kappa Delta Phi &mdash; or if you can&rsquo;t recognize Greek letters yet, we&rsquo;re wearing the purple and white!!! </p>

<h1>What is the New Member Education Process?</h1>
<p>The New Member Education Process is the final step towards joining our eternal sisterhood, essentially helping members in their education and knowledge of the sorority. aKDPhi&rsquo;s New Member Education Process is specifically designed and created to develop well&ndash;rounded and independent individuals. Through the process, you will make life long sisters, learn a great deal about yourself, and discover aKDPhi&rsquo;s vision. However, the New Member Education Process is a serious decision and one that does require time and energy, as anything worthwhile in life does &mdash; so commitment is key to success. You can also think about it this way, for seventeen years, thousands of sisters nationwide have completed it without fail in the past, so there is NO reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t! If you ever have any questions, feel free to ask sisters or e&ndash;mail us (contact information below) &mdash; believe us when we say that we have heard EVERY question under the rainbow. There is no question that we consider stupid &mdash; so don&rsquo;t be shy! We will try our hardest to address your concerns as best we can.</p>

<h1>What is hazing and does alpha Kappa Delta Phi haze?</h1>
<p>The purpose of sorority education consists of education about the sorority and chapter. New members should demonstrate a desire and ability to support alpha Kappa Delta Phi's sorority standards. Hazing, defined as "any action taken or situation created to produce mental or physical discomfort, embarrassment, harassment, or ridicule," is not condoned nor tolerated.</p>

<h1>Will this affect my schoolwork?</h1>
<p>The sisters of aKDPhi at the University of Michigan believe that as a college student, you are first and foremost responsible to your academics. We are here, after all, to graduate and earn a degree! You will find no one better at time management than the sisters of aKDPhi, and a large part of our New Member Education Process revolves around teaching future sisters our secrets of time management, especially in the area of academics. Sisters have gone through the process successfully in the past with 3.5&ndash;4.0 GPA&rsquo;s! It is not unheard of, and very possible, with a good work ethic and strong sense of time management. Additionally, aKDPhi&rsquo;s board provides you with an Academic Chair who will help to monitor your grades, set up tutoring, and plan your weekly schedules, should you require the assistance.</p>

<h1>Are there scholarships?</h1>
<p>Yes! Our National Alumnae Board hopes to contribute to the successful future of exemplary active sisters who continue to uphold the standards and integrity of alpha Kappa Delta Phi.</p>

<h1>I&rsquo;m not sure if my parents will let me do this, is there anyway I can convince them?</h1>
p>aKDPhi strongly encourages the support of your parents and your family in your decision to join our sorority. It is important that they understand who we are, what we do, and what we&rsquo;re about. We encourage you to take the time to visit our website with them, show them the different aspects of our sorority, and read our alumnae testimonials! In addition, there is also a <a href="letter.html">letter to parents</a> that we have included in our website to better describe aKDPhi. If you required the letter to be translated into a different language, please ask us and we will provide you with that, as well!</p>

<h2>Avon Breast Cancer Crusade</h2>
<p>The Avon Breast Cancer Crusade raises funds and awareness for breast cancer research and to advance access to care, with a focus on the medically underserved. From its launch in 1992, Avon&rsquo;s Global Breast Cancer Crusade has expanded to
more than 55 countries and by the end of 2009 had raised and awarded more than $640 million. Grants are made in five areas: breast cancer education and awareness, screening and diagnosis, access to treatment, support services and scientific research. The largest source of funds for the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade is the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer.</p>
 <p>The Avon Walks are non&ndash;competitive weekend fundraising walks for all fitness levels. Since the launch of the series in 2003, more than $320 million has been raised through the dedication of over 120,000 participating women and men. The Walks take place in 9 cities, covering 39 miles in two days, and raise awareness and funds to fight breast cancer.</p>
 
<p>Progress has been made but there is still a new diagnosis of breast cancer in the U.S. every 3 minutes. The Avon Foundation for Women supports research to accelerate knowledge about the causes, diagnosis, treatments, and ways to prevent breast cancer.
It works to facilitate research collaborations and to identify and fund new research directions. The Foundation also supports efforts to ensure the best quality of care for all, regardless of insurance status or ability to pay.</p>

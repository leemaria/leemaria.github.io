<p>Since its initiation at University of Michigan, the sisters of alpha Kappa Delta Phi have strived to maintain high academic excellence. Many of our sisters have been honored with academic scholarships from both inside and outside of the university. We maintain one of the highest levels of quality and integrity and continually stress the importance of our academic studies. Our academic chair monitors the GPAs of all of the active sisters and maintains study hours for sisters to attend in groups to ensure academic merit.</p>

<p>One of the many goals of alpha Kappa Delta Phi is to promote the development of a successful woman. In many ways, we are able to develop stronger characters to be able to stand up for ourselves as Asian American women in this society. Through the resources of our alumnae and active sisters, we are able to do just that. It is such a joy to see sisters grow and mature every year into the beautiful women they are today. </p>

<p>(If you are interested in co-hosting an academic event or having us attend yours, please contact our academic chair.)</p>

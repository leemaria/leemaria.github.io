<b>Favorite Quote:</b> Every song has a CODA, a final movement. Whether it fades out or crashes away. Every song ends. Is that any reason not to enjoy the music? The truth is, there is nothing to be afraid of. It's just life<br>
<b>Best thing about aKDPhi:</b> Having a group of girls you can do anything with and who are always there for you. Getting my Big and my little sis. Growing as a leader with positions in aKDPhi.

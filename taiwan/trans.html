<h1>Transportation</h1>
<h3>Traveling throughout Campus</h3>
<p>
Don’t worry about transportation if you are planning to live on North Campus (Northwood apartments, Bursley & Baits Housing) because the University of Michigan’s free blue buses have stops all throughout these housing complexes. These buses can take you from North Campus to Central Campus in less than twenty minutes. U of M’s blue buses stop in front of all the major buildings, so you don’t have to worry about walking through tons of snow to get to class! 
</p><p>
If you get put into Oxford Housing, no big deal! Oxford Housing is a ten to fifteen minute walk from campus. If you get lazy or just don’t feel like walking, there’s always the Oxford Shuttle, powered by U of M's blue bus, to get you to class! This bus is free and stops in front of CC Little and the Diag.</p>
<h3>Studying til late at night? No problem!</h3>
<p>
The Night Ride (734.528.5432), run by the AATA is a subsidized, low cost, shared nighttime cab service that travels within the Ann Arbor City limits. The cost to ride is $5.00 per person, regardless of the distance traveled. They run Monday through Friday, 11PM -6AM, and Saturday & Sunday, 7PM to 7:30AM. The Ride Home (734.663.3355) is sponsored by the University of Michigan. It’s a free taxi service that provides transportation from the Shapiro Undergraduate Library on Central Campus (also known as the UGLI) or from the Duderstadt Center on North Campus to your residence. This service is only available after the University buses have stopped running. To request a ride, talk to someone at the main reference desk. Another option is Safe Walk (734.763.9255). This is available after the buses stop running, and picks you up from any central or north campus site, and will take you anywhere within a twenty minute walk or one mile drive of central of north campus diags.</p>
<h3>Need to be away from campus to enjoy the town?</h3>
<p>Making your way around Ann Arbor is very easy. With your Mcard, you can ride any AATA (Ann Arbor Transportation Authority) fixed bus route for free! If you feel the need to go grocery shopping at Meijer, or just need a break at Briarwood Mall, the AATA buses that go there stop conveniently in front of the Michigan Union. If you need to go to the north side of town, buses conveniently stop next to C.C Little on North University. If you need to go east to the largest Chinese grocery store in town, you can conveniently take Route 4, that stops on the corner of Washtenaw and S. Forest (very close to University Towers Apartments). Schedules of fixed bus routes can be found here: <a href="http://www.theride.org/" target="_blank">http://www.theride.org/</a>.</p>
<h3>Going to the Airport?</h3>
<p>Do you need to go to the airport to catch a flight during scheduled UM school breaks? The best way is take advantage of the MSA airbus service. They pick up in three locations around campus, and you can pay by cash, check, or charge it to your student account. Tickets are sold at the Michigan Union Ticket Office (MUTO). A reserved seat is $8 one-way, or $13 round-trip. Non-reserved seats are sold on a first come, first serve basis and cost $10 each way. <b>THIS ONLY RUNS PRIOR TO SCHEDULED UM SCHOOL BREAKS.</b></p>

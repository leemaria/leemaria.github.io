<!--<b>Description:</b>	 Flyer designed for the GenAPA 2011 Preparty.  GenAPA is the largest pan-Asian culture show in the midwest that attracts over 300 participants and culturally diverse audience.  Fusion happens to celebrate the hard work that preformers and core put into the show, and is named because it &quot;fuses&quot; the Asian-American community together.  I designed this flyer with that in mind.  I wanted to make a flyer that blended everything together in a smooth fashion.  I used various colors and font styles to accentuate this.</p>-->

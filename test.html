<b>Description:</b>	 Flyer designed for Lunar Ball 2011, an event that celebrates Lunar New Years. Red and yellow are both festive colors representing luck, fortune and prosperity in Chinese culture. Thus, I wanted to create a flyer that was eye catching as well as relevent to fellow Chinese students on the University of Michigan campus. 2011 is the year of the rabbit in the Chinese zodiac.</p>
